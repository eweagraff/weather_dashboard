# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The following is a weather dashboard that displays current city selected. It will also display a 5-day forecast. The technologies used to create this assignment were utilizing an API by generating a key from openweather.org and using the public weather API. Then a fetch request was required to obtain the information such as current city, temp, humidity, and wind speed.
